to save the data in local storage
I.How do we save our seats locally by using Local Storage?

1. if u console.log(selectedSeats) it gives the nodelist of selected seats like "div.seat.selected"
2.but we can't save this node list 
3. we need to create basically array of index to save it in locally
4. in order to do that we gonna do three things 
  a. copy selected seats into array
  b. map through that array
  c. return the new array of indexes
  d. we gonna use spread optr do the above

5.Save it in local storage
